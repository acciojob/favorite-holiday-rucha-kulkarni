	<h1>Paris</h1>
	<br>
	<p>
		Paris is monumental, both due to its size but also its wealth of architectural heritage! The symbol of the capital city, and doubtless its best-known monument, is the unique Eiffel Tower, the "Iron Lady" that offers visitors an unsurpassed view. Close by is the equally iconic Arc de Triomphe. This historical landmark dazzles onlookers on summer days, when the sun sets through the huge arch. Notre Dame Cathedral, a masterpiece of Gothic architecture, is another magnificent and unmissable sight, where you can admire sculptures, the nave, towers and even the crypt! Just as evocative, the Sacré-Cœur Basilica has been the source of inspiration for writers and film-makers.
		In addition to its splendid monuments, Paris is home to a wealth of museums. Who hasn't heard of the Louvre? This magnificent building, famous for its architecture featuring a glass pyramid, has been one of the largest museums in the world for over two centuries, containing 35,000 works of art in 8 different departments and no fewer than 60,600 m² of rooms housing the permanent collection! The Musée d'Orsay, on the other hand, is a former train station featuring a monumental clock that is best known for its imposing collection of Impressionist art.You can visit Paris, but you also have to live Paris. A visit to the city is not complete without taking time to enjoy its emblematic "art de vivre"! A coffee on the terrace of one of the Paris bistrots, a quick lunch in a brasserie, a sumptuous dinner in a gastronomic restaurant, foreign food or a district speciality, such as the Saint-Michel fallafels or the Montparnasse Brittany biscuits... There are so many ways of eating! Paris is also the capital of fashion and shopping.
